                                                       -: EXCEPTION :-
                                                      ....................
->Exception is an interuption which will occur during programme excution.
->When exception occur remaining lines of code get terminated which we called abnormal termination.
->To handle exception we use 5 keywords i.e throw,throws,try,catch,finally.
->in java exception are occure at RUNTIME.
->When we handled exception then program folw will not terminate.
->In java exception are classes.
->Throwable is the root classes for the exception which is present in java.lang package.
->It is 2 types i.e. Error(Stack overflow,Virtual memory) and Exception(Checked,Unchecked).
->Checked Exception(CompileTime) i.e. ClassNotFound Exception,FileNotFound Exception,I/O Exception,Interupted Exception.
->UnChecked Exception(RunTime) i.e. Arithmatic exception,NullPointer Exception,StringIndexOutofbound Exception,ArrayIndexOutofBound Exception,NumberFormat Exception.

EXAMPLE:
..............................................................
public class Demo{
    public  static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("main start");
        try{
            int a=10,b=0;
            int c=a/b;

            System.out.println(c);
        }
        Catch(Exception e){
            e.printStackTrace();
            e.getMessage();
            System.out.println("Exception handled");
        }
    }
}
................................................................
1)try:-
........
->try is a keyword used in exception handling.
->Inside try block we can write risky line of code which are responsible for for the exception.
->We can not write try block alone , it is always associted with try with catch keyword or finally block.
->For one try block we can write multiple catch block.

Example:
.................................................................................
public class Demo{
    public  static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("main start");
        try{
            int a=10,b=0;
            int c=a/b;

            System.out.println(c);
        }
        Catch(Exception e){
            e.printStackTrace();
            e.getMessage();
            System.out.println("Exception handled");
        }
        Catch(ArithmaticException ae){
            ae.printStackTrace();
            ae.getMessage();
            System.out.println("ArithmaticException handled");
        }
        Catch(NullPointerException ne){
            ne.printStackTrace();
            ne.getMessage();
            System.out.println("Nullpointer exception handled");
        }
    }
}
....................................................................................

2)Catch():-
.............
->Catch is a keyword ehich is used for catch or handled exception.
->We should not catch block alone.
->Catch block is always associted with try block.
->We should not write any line between try and catch block.
->When we are writting multiple catch block we have to follow the order of sub type to super type.
->catch block is execute when exception will occur in try block.
->Catch block is provide alternate solution for thr exception.

3)finally| :-
..................
->Finally is a block & keyword used in excdption handling.
->Finally block is  always executed wheather exception will occure or not.
->finally block is executed before executing the return statement.
->finally block we are using for costly resourses like database closing connection file closing.
-If their is try,catch and finally then after executing try catch finally block is executed.

->Default Exception:
......................
->The exception which are not handled by user it is handled by jvm by terminating the current execution.
->Default exception is are part of jvm which is going to handle an exception by terminating the current excution.

4)throw:-
...........
->throw is a keyword is used to throw an exception.
->By using throw we can throw both checked and unChecked exception.
->By using throw keyword we can throw only one keyword at a time.
->throw keyword we are using inside a method block.
5)throws:-
...........
->throws is a keyword is used to declare an exception.
->By using throws we can throws both checked and Unchecked exception.
->By using throw keyword we can throws multiple exception at a single time.
->throws keyword we are used along with the method signature.

->Propagation:-
................
->Passing an exception to its caller method is known as propagation.
->We can propagate the exception by using throws keyword.
->Exception propagation is implicit for Unchecked exception.
->Exception propagation is explicit for checked exception.
->By using throws keyword we can declare multiple exception. like FileNotFound exception,ClassNotFound exception etc..

Difference between checked and Unchecked exception.
......................................................
1)Checked Exception:-
.....................
->The exception which are handled by at the time of compile time those are called checked exception.
->It is also called as compiler known exception.
->Handling is mandatory for checked exception.
->Propagation is implicit for checked exception.
->Ex:-ClassNotFound exception,FileNotFound exception,I/O exception,Interupted exception.

2)unChecked Exception:-
.........................
->The exception which are handled by at the time of runtime those are called unCheckedchecked exception.
->It is also called as compiler unknown exception.
->Handling is not mandatory for unCheckedchecked exception.
->Propagation is explicit for unCheckedchecked exception.
->Ex:-Arithmatic exception,NullPointer exception,NumberFormat exception,ArrayIndexOutofBound exception etc...
